## HR Analytics: Job Change of Data Scientists

**Introduction** The companies actively involved in big data and analytics spend money on employees to train and hire them for data scientist positions. However, according to me it seems some candidates leave the company once trained. Hence to reduce the cost on training, company want to predict which candidates are really interested in working for the company and which candidates may look for new employment once trained. On the basis of the characteristics of the employees the HR of the want to understand the factors affecting the decision of an employee for staying or leaving the current job.

**Description of dataset**: The dataset I am planning to use is from kaggle.  The dataset has already been divided into testing and training sets. Training data has 14 features on 19158 observations and 2129 observations with 13 features in testing dataset. 
Some notes about the data: The data is imbalanced, most features are categorical, some with cardinality and missing imputation can be part of pipeline (as mentioned on kaggle)
